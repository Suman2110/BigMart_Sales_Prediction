# BigMart_Sales_Prediction
The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store at BigMart.
This helps the decision makers to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales.
Using this model, we will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales. 

# Dataset Description 
BigMart has collected sales data from the year 2013, for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Where the dataset consists of 12 attributes like Item Fat, Item Type, Item MRP, Outlet Type, Item Visibility, Item Weight, Outlet Identifier, Outlet Size, Outlet Establishment Year, Outlet Location Type, Item Identifier and Item Outlet Sales. Out of these attributes response variable is the Item Outlet Sales attribute and remaining attributes are used as the predictor variables.

The data-set is also based on hypotheses of store level and product level. Where store level involves attributes like:- city, population density, store capacity, location, etc and the product level hypotheses involves attributes like:- brand, advertisement, promotional offer, etc.
